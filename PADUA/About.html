                    <h2>Hi! I am <span>Francesca!</span></h2>
                    <h4>Web Developer <span> & Designer</span></h3>
                    <p>I am a first year student taking IT course in Our Lady of Fatima University - Antipolo. 
                        I can create a static website from hard coding and from my unique idea. I also revamp my 
                        previous works to view my progress in web development. This website serves as a platform for me to share my thoughts, 
                        experiences, and ideas with you. Here, you'll find a collection of arts, mental illnesses, and stories that aim to spark 
                        conversations and ignite your heart and mind. I hope to create a space where we can connect, learn from each other, and 
                        explore the wonders of the world together.

                        Thank you for visiting my website. I invite you to join me on this journey of discovery, where we can explore the 
                        beauty of this language, unravel the mysteries of the human experience, and celebrate the richness of our shared humanity.</p>
